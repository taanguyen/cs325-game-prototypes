<h2>Go for Gold</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game is a spin on the classic snake game, but instead of an elongating snake, the ship grows and shrinks according to number of coins collected.
The bullets decrease ship health while visiting the island restores health.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game involves particle emitters! I also made the ship more realistic by disallowing the down key, and restricting players to the up, right, and left arrow keys.
The game also has a best score keeper and a health tracker, which I've never incorporated before. The bullets are aimed at the coin, and the changing ship size make the game interesting.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use emitters and how to use angles in phaser to aim the bullets. I also learned how to maintain game information (best score).
The hardest part of making this game was figuring out how to aim the bullets, as well as how to make the ship trail resemble the foamy trail we see in real life. I experimented with
several different kinds of particle pngs before figuring out that whispy white effect.

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Pirate ship: <a href="https://seanholden.net/blog/misty-pirates-a-look-back/">Pirate ship</a></li>
<li>Bullet: <a href="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/d/5/T/A/K/2/red-circle-hi.png">Bullet</a></li>
<li>Island: <a href="http://moziru.com/explore/Island%20clipart%20transparent%20background/">Islandp</a></li>
<li>Coin: <a href="https://codepen.io/aleksoft/pen/hsdLI">Gold Coin</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game most closely resembles snake. The game is about collecting coins, and growing in size.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect coins and dodge bullets.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Pirate theme used for this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard, Randomness: somewhat determinstic game, since the bullets are aimed at the coins but the coins are randomly placed, Genre: Overhead, and Play style: Collector and Competitor.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The primary game mechanic involves timing and dodging dangerous bullets. The second game mechanic is navigation using keyboard keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Lots of fun hopefully!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Pirates love gold! Collect gold by steering the ship toward the floating coins. To navigate, use the up, left, and right arrow keys. In a pinch, speed up the ship by simultaneously clicking the up key and space bar.
Players should be wary of drifting too far from shore while collecting coins. Every five coins collected will make the ship bulge. Once 20 or more coins have been collected, the player can dump the coins by navigating to the island.
Visiting the island allows the player to regain two health points. Each bullet inflicts health damage.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Wait for the bullet to pass by the coin and don't rush in collecting coins. Another stategy is to stay relatively close the island to regain health.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You and your pirate crew are sailing the seas for gold!! But the ship isn't large enough to accomodate too much gold, so you have to be careful.
Davy Jones is also hunting for gold, and he wants to shoot you down!! Beware the red bullets. The island is the only place to dump your gold.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone ages 7 and up can play this game!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Roughly 2 - 4 minutes.
</li>
