<h2>Reach for the Stars</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
  Most games with ball and paddle that I've seen have a single paddle. This game uses two paddles, and two sets of controls that vary
  while playing the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
When a player hits a star that has a letter,
the game control with the same color as the star changes to the key of the letter above the star.
For example, hitting a pink star with 'K' above it means the rightbar UP control is now the K key.
Another feature of the game is the UI, and the illusion that the game extends infinitely upward.
The night sky is also constantly generating background stars, as the camera fixates on the ball.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot from this game! I learned how to make a class in JS, how to fixate objects on the screen, using the camera.
I also learned how to continuously generate sprites, while simultenously deleting sprites to save memory. I learned how to
manipulate keys, as they are really just integers, in phaser.
The hardest part of this game was making the stars, and making interactions with the stars. The text associated to the star
changes gameplay.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made the left and right paddles. I also made the background dots. The following sprites were borrowed:
<ul>
<li>Ball: <a href="http://sonic.wikia.com/wiki/File:Shield_in_Sonic_Runners.png">Ball</a></li>
</ul>Star: <a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/17032/iconstar">Star</a></li>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game that most closely resembles my game is the classic brick breaker/ pong game.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect stars by getting the ball to hit the stars; game ends if the ball flies off to the left or right.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Stargazing
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>

Play style : collector, randomness: lots of randomly placed stars, deterministic in that players can aim for the stars, input: keyboard, genre: (vertical) side-scroller
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic of this prototype involves hitting a ball left and right to win collectable stars. Ss player advances in the game, keyboard controls change.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players hopefully have fun, maybe they experience frustration as they get used to the changing keyboard controls!
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Using the two left and right paddles, a player can collect stars to win points. The goal is to earn as many points as possible by moving the paddles up and down.
The best stars to collect are the yellow ones. Collecting other stars will change the keyboard controls. If the ball floats off to the left or right world bounds, the game is over.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Keeping the ball in motion is a tough challenge. One strategy to avoid keyboard changes is to aim for the yellow stars.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The game is abstract and there are no characters. The ball is simply lost in space, in a universe where there is no gravity,
and stars are of multiple colors. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Audience is anyone ages 8 and up.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Anywhere from 10 seconds to several minutes (based on skill level).
</li>

</ul>
