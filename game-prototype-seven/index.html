<h2>Give Me TLC (Sandwiches)!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The math-based game is original in that it chellenges players to mmake quick decisions based on ratio values. It seems simple
but is in fact quite difficult! The way score is calculated is also an original device.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The game incorporates an animated timer (the time bar on top) which employs a tween! The game also uses list parsing to display the score.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to make an illusion of a cropping rectangle graphic. I also learned how to make a second clock (the time left) sync
with the visual "cropping" timer. The hardest part of making this game was coming up with a reasonable scoring system.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Tomato: <a href="http://www.digitalistmag.com/future-of-work/2016/02/25/importance-feedback-loop-04038491">Tomato</a></li>
<li>Cheese: <a href="https://thecomputermouse.deviantart.com/art/Kawaii-Cheese-297878024">Cheese</a></li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game most closely resembles the 123 game (https://phaser.io/news/2017/09/123-game-tutorial-updated). Instead of addition and subtraction, this game
tests a player's ability to do all four basic operations quickly. Part of the tweening code was also borrowed from the aforementioned tutorial.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In one minute, build sanwiches given the provided ratios by buying ingredients in the indicated amounts.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
  Making a sandwich!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: left mouse click; Randomness: a lot of randomness; genre: math/ decision-making; play style: joker
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic is evaluating a player's ability to make decisions quickly and compute arithmetic operations under time pressure.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Fun and maybe some stress from time pressure
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The only way to play this game is to buy or not buy ingredients using the left mouse click. The player must decide every two seconds whether to take an ingredient or pass up the item to wait for another ingredient.
The core mechanic is fast decision-making and accurate arithemtic calulations.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is so mch randomness that strategy isn't really useful. One way to enhance performance in the game is to
buy the ingredient that has the lowest desired amount according to the recipe. That ingredient determines how many sandwiches can be made,
which corresponds to number of total sandwiches.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Your mom loves veggie sandwiches but you're running out of time!
She has a particular taste so you have to do your best to meet her desired flavor profile.
Before going on the picnic, you've decided to buy ingredients to make as many sandwiches as possible.
The gameplay tension happens as you buy the ingredients but you don't want to overspend and buy too many ingredients.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players ages 8+ will enjoy this game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 minute
</li>
