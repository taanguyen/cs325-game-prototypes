<h2>Save The City</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is a guessing and memory game. It's a cross between chutes and ladders with Minesweeper!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The particle effects and visual health meter, along with explosive audio are the polish aspects of this prototype that took up
a lot of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to better use particle effects and how to create a grid-based game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Background <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/zGxJ2">Ruined city</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
When I came up with this game, I had minesweeper in mind. During this iteration, I realized that my game also resembles chutes and ladders in that players can fall down
one level by stepping into a hole (a chute).
I borrowed InputControl.js (author: Huu Vu). I also borrowed Phaser's earthquake example code:  https://phaser.io/examples/v2/tweens/earthquake
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Navigate the 4x4 grid using arrow keys; avoid hidden bombs and win the game by getting to the green square on the fifth level
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Soldier
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Input: keyboard arrow keys; Genre: Memory game; Randomness: Deterministic (all bombs, green squares, and holes are preset); Play style: Achiever
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic in is assesing player's short-term memory.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Fun and mild frustration
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
To play this game, the player will navigate the grid by using the up, down, left, and right arrow keys. To advance to the next level, the player must
land on the green square. On each level, there are three hidden bombs. Thus, the game involves guesswork and a bit of short-term memory to avoid bombs.
Everytime the player detonates a bomb, he/she will lose one health point (indicated at the bottom of the game). If the player successfully lands on
the green square on the 5th level, he/she wins!
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The only strategy in this game is to rely on memory to avoid known bombs.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
An evil bomb squad has planted bombs all over the city. To safely disarm all 15 bombs, you must reach the green square on the 5th level. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players 6 and up will enjoy this game!
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes.
</li>
