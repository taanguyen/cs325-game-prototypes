<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game has a pichu that floats around receiving emoji kisses.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
In the game, the pichu glides and controlling the pichu takes some concentration
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that Phaser is tough to implement correctly without proper game knowledge! I also struggled with implementing the physics correctly.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? The hardest part of making this game was learning basic Phaser and implementing physics components the way I imagined.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li> Emoji kiss image: <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/pix.iemoji.com/images/emoji/apple/ios-11/256/face-blowing-a-kiss.png">Kiss Emoji</a></li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I don't know of a game that most closely resembles this one (it's too simple!). I borrowed code and got inspiration from a couple Phaser examples.
<ul>
<li> Arcade Physics Example: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/gravity"></a></li>
<li> Keyboard Input Example: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/keyboard"></a></li>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Receive kisses by moving the pichu around the bounding box using arrow keys.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I used the memories of a kiss theme.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
I used keyboard input, a random number function to randomly place the emoji kisses, a casual game genre (no strategy involved), and simple play style.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game has a capture mechanic, but no strategy involved. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope players will enjoy the cuteness of pichu gliding along the screen and collecting emoji kisses.

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game has no win or lose mechanism. Players are told to simply move the pichu around the bounding box to collect all five kisses.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The game doesn't involve strategy.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Valentine's Day is coming up! A small, lonely pichu finds out that love is in the air, so the pichu goes around receiving kisses from total strangers.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Really young children, ages 5 and under.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Less than a minute.
</li>
