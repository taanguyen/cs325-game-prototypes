<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game? My game has a pichu that floats around receiving emoji kisses.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology? In the game, the pichu glides and controlling the pichu takes some concentration
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? I learned that Phaser is tough to implement correctly without proper game knowledge! I also struggled with implementing the physics correctly.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? The hardest part of making this game was learning basic Phaser and implementing physics components the way I imagined.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
I borrowed code and got inspiration from a couple Phaser examples\n
Examples:
<li> Arcade Physics Example: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/arcade-physics/gravity"></a></li>
<li> Keyboard Input Example: <a href="http://phaser.io/examples/v2/input/keyboard"></a></li>
