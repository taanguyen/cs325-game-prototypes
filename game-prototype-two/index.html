<h2>Chicken Scramble</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game has falling objects that can only be avoided rather than maneuvered around. Games I've played typically have obstacles coming at the player horizontally, but this game makes object fall toward the player vertically.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My previous game generated 5 emoji sprites in random locations.
For this game, I was able to generate an infinite number of knives with a time delay between each instantiation of knife.
The gum also employs a similar "spontaneous generation" mechanism, but it also reduces the chicken's velocity when the chicken collides with the gum.
The gum appears 100 pixels to the left or right of the chicken (depending on the outcome of Math.random) because I specifically set the x-coordinate of the gum to chick.body.x with the 100 pixel offset.
Lastly, the chicken has animation!!! When the player moves the chicken left and right, the chicken actually appears to move left and right.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
For this game, I learned how to animate sprites using a spritesheet. I also learned how to create sprites on an infinite loop.
The hardest part of making this game was generating an infinite number of knives. The only way I could think of doing this was by making a phaser time event.
Luckily, Hu helped me figure out a way to make this process an infinite loop. Shoutout to Hu! Another challenging part of this project was animating the chicken.
I wasn't familiar with how frames are read off a spritesheet in phaser (for example, which frame is frame 1 vs. frame 6?), so that took a lot of trial and error.
The easiest part of making this game was adding text!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made one asset from scratch using MS Paint- the magenta ground that the chicken walks across! The rest of the assets were borrowed.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game most closely resembles this game I found on the internet (just found this game after developing my own): http://www.agame.com/game/asteroid-dodge
I borrowed keyboard input code from a Phaser tutorial: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part6
I also borrowed audio fade in from Phaser: https://phaser.io/examples/v2/audio/fade-in
I learned how to animate sprites using this YouTube tutorial (but I didn't copy that code): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjQi_WB1EqE&t=419s
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The chicken needs to get across the kitchen without being impaled by falling knives.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme I used was chicken!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game uses keyboard input and a lot of randomness (knives and gum splashes are randomly generated).
The genre of this game is side-scroller (although the game doesn't scroll, the camera view is set to side view). The play style is Joker.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic involves dodging falling knives. The goak for this game was to keep players on their toes as they navigate across the kitchen.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope players will have fun as they try to dodge the falling knives.
It might make players tense up a little while avoiding the dangerous knives.
The jazz music in the background is supposed to supplement the homey feel of the game. 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players can only use the left and right arrow keys to move the chicken across the kitchen. Once a knife touches the chicken, the game is over.
When the chicken steps on the gum, its velocity will automatically be reduced for one second. The only way to avoid the gum is to wait for it to disappear.
</li>


<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The gum can be eliminated in two ways: by bumping into it or simply waiting for it to disappear after a couple seconds.
To get to the right side of the screen, players can move the chicken right or left to avoid the gum/knives, and charge forward when the coast is clear.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Grilled Chicken Special is being offered tonight at grandma's house. The chicken needs to escape before it becomes dinner!! But the only way out of the hazardous restaurant kitchen is by exiting the side.
And her 50 grandkids have left chewed gum lying around (yuck!), so the chicken has to be careful as it dashes across.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is suitable for young children, ages 11 and under.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game can be completed within 5 to 30 seconds!
