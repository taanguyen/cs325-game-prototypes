<h2>Chicken Scramble</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The game has falling objects that can only be avoided rather than maneuvered around. Games I've played typically have obstacles coming at the player horizontally, but this game makes object fall toward the player vertically.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My previous game generated 5 emkoji sprites in random locations.
For this game, I was able to generate an infinite number of knives with a time delay between each instantiation of knife.
The gum also employs a similar "spontaneous generation" mechanism, but it also reduces the chicken's velocity when the chicken collides with the gum.
The gum appears 100 pixels to the left or right of the chicken (depending on the outcome of Math.random) because I specifically set the x-coordinate of the gum to chick.body.x with the 100 pixel offset.
Lastly, the chicken has animation!!! When the player moves the chicken left and right, the chicken actually appears to move left and right.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
For this game, I learned how to animate sprites using a spritesheet. I also learned how to create sprites on an infinite loop.
The hardest part of making this game was generating an infinite number of knives. The only way I could think of doing this was by making a phaser time event.
Luckily, Hu helped me figure out a way to make this process an infinite loop. Shoutout to Hu! Another challenging part of this project was animating the chicken.
I wasn't familiar with how frames are read off a spritesheet in phaser (for example, which frame is frame 1 vs. frame 6?), so that took a lot of trial and error.
The easiest part of making this game was adding text!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made one asset from scratch using MS Paint- the magenta ground that the chicken walks across! The rest of the assets were borrowed.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game most closely resembles
I borrowed keyboard input code from a Phaser tutorial: https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-game/part6
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The chicken needs to get across the kitchen without being impaled by falling knives.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme I used was chicken!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The game uses keyboard input and a lot of randomness (knives and gum splashes are randomly generated).
The genre of this game is side-scroller (although the game doesn't scroll, the camera view is set to side view). The play style is Joker.

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanic is
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I hope players will have fun as they try to dodge the falling knives. It might make players tense up a little while avoiding the dangerous knives.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players can only use the left and right arrow keys to move the chicken across the kitchen. 
</li>


<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The gum can be eliminated in two ways: by bumping into it or simply waiting for it to disappear after a couple seconds.
To get to the right side of the screen, players can move the chicken right or left to avoid the gum, and charge forward when the coast is clear.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is suitable for young children, ages 11 and under.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The game can be completed within 5 to 30 seconds!
</li>
