<h2>Musical Memory</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game involves memorizing a random sequence of sounds and then repeating the sequence in order perfectly. I've only ever played memory games that involve
finding matching cards, so I hope this idea is original!
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
For this game, I implemented a few features: tweens to display numbers and sprites, drag and drop with snap-to-place action, left-clicking on a sprite enables dragging while right-clicking
on a sprite replays the sound associated with the sprite. I also made text buttons for the first time. The submit button changes to visible when the player
is ready to submit an answer, and the repeat button allows the player to hear the sequence one more time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot making this prototype! I learned how to make drag and drop interaction, I learned to use Phaser's shuffle method, how to play sounds in sequence (at first, the sounds kept playing all at once), and I
learned how to capture mouse clicking to make the right and left clicks distinct events. I also used tweens for the first time.
The hardest part of making this game, aside from getting the sounds to play in sequence (spent hours on this!! eventually resorted to internet forum), was getting the snap-to-place action to happen correctly. I used a distance checking method orginally and it wasn't working. Before this, I only
ever did collision checking between two sprites. The snap-to-place feature was implemented using .contains() and Phaser rectangle.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Sound playing in sequence: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43424355/waiting-for-a-sound-to-stop-before-playing-the-next-sound
This game is closest to card matching games and the physical Simon game with sound (though I didn't know about the Simon game when I came up with this idea).
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Put the images in the same order as the sequence of sounds.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Soap Opera Addict
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
input: mouse; randomness: lots of randomness because the sounds are randomly shuffled every round; play style: Craftsman; genre: memory testing
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The mechanic involved in this game is short-term memory/ auditory memory. The interaction mechanic is drag and drop, with distinct right and left mouse clicks.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Overall fun and enjoyable experience; a bit of frustration if the player loses.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players will hear a sequence of randomly shuffled sounds. They can click on yes to hear the sounds again, but only one more time.
To win the game, players must drag and drop the images to their corresponding locations in the auditory sequence (if the opera audio clip happened first, place the opera masks on number 1).
Once all 6 images have been placed, hit SUBMIT.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There isn't really any strategy in this game. Players may write down the sequence as it is heard, but that would defeat the purpose of this game :(
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The composer for the hit soap opera, Days of Our Lives in CS 325, needs original content for the show! But he's having trouble remembering
what parts go where. It's up to you to help him out!
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone ages 6 and up.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
1 to 2 minutes
</li>
